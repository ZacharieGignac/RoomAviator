# Room Aviator
An HTML Cisco Room Navigator Clone

## Warning. This is so a prototype. Use at your own risk!
It's not really tested. Not really any error handling. I'm doing this part-time.

## What I am trying to do
I'm trying to make an almost 1:1 replica of the Room Navigator.

## Will try to include:
* Home screen with icons and bookings
* Status bar at the top
* Standby and halfwake screen
* Custom panels
* Action buttons
* Dial screen
* In-call screen
* Codec info and settings

## Usage
* Edit the config.js and enter your credentials
* Open index.html
* ???
* Profit!


## What works for now
* Home screen with icons on the right
* Custom panels with almost all widgets (excep spacing and directional pad)
* Standby screen with a white led on the bezel
* Halfwake screen
* Volume buttons and mute toggle on homescreen
* Volume popup with slider display

## If you find it cool...
Consider helping by giving ideas and finding bugs. Please file issues :)
